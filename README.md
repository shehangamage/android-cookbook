# Hello World!

The fact that you're here means you want to *read* this cookbook or even *add something to it*. You're very welcome to do any of those things! :)
This Readme is intended to help you get started.

## What is this cookbook?

The cookbook you're looking at is a collection of best practices we, Android team of UPTech, use in our development workdays. As it's a book, it consists of *chapters*. Each chapter covers a specific topic in Android development. Some great examples include *Architecture*, *CI and CD*, *Version Control*, *Animations*, etc.

## How to read:
**Step 1.** Find what you want to read about. 
  
**Step 2.** Read it.  
  
**There is no step 3.** 

## How to write
A bit more steps here, but don't worry, still not that many to close the page right away.

**Step 1.** Decide what the topic will be. 
  
**Step 2.** Create a new branch from *master*, name it like *chapter/your_topic*.  
  
**Step 3.** Add any files needed in that branch. Usually it's a *ChapterName.md* file with all info you want to describe. We use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to make our text cool and readable.  
  
  **3.a)** If you need any additional files - please create a folder where you can put all files related to that chapter. For example:  
  - *Architecture/*   
    - *CleanArchitecture.md*   
    - *Redux.md*   
    - *MVVM.md*   
  
**Step 4.** After you've finished adding information and you are ready to present your work to the team, **create a Pull Request to master** from your branch and **request reviews from all team members** on that PR. This is important, since we want everyone to use this cookbook and thus be aware of the recommendations we keep here.  
*Hint: you can easily do it by typing android in the reviewer's input and choosing uptechteam/android: it will automatically request reviews from all the Android team.*  
  
**Step 5.** After **everyone approves your PR**, feel free to **merge your Pull Request** and **delete the branch**.  
**There is no Step 6.**   

Congratulations, you just made the Android cookbook a bit better!
